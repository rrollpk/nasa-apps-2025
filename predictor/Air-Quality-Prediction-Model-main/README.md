## Introduction
Air quality is a critical factor affecting public health and the environment. This project leverages machine learning to predict air quality levels based on historical data and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pollutant concentrations, and more. The model can be used by researchers, policymakers, and the general public to make informed decisions about air quality management.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess air quality data for accurate predictions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement various machine learning algorithms to predict air quality.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to understand trends and patterns in air quality data.
- **Scalability**: The model can be scaled to incorporate additional features and larger datasets.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eteh1/Air-Quality-Prediction-Model.git
   cd Air-Quality-Prediction-Model
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the Air Quality Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your dataset**:
   - Ensure your dataset is in CSV format.
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. **Run the preprocessing script**:
   ```bash
   python src/preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

4. **Make predictions**:
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py
   ```

5. **Visualize the results**:
   ```bash
   python src/visualize.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical air quality data, including various environmental factors. You can use your own dataset or download a sample dataset from [here](https://example.com/dataset).

## Model
The model is built using popular machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`. It includes the following algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

You can easily extend the model to include other algorithms or techniques.
